CHANGELOG
=========

v0.0.3
------

Moved some of the standard Rakefile boilerplate into FunWith::Gems::Rakefile.  Goal is to simplify rakefiles, add a set of fun_with:gems: rake tasks, etc.
Removed Mechanic (seemed pretty useless)


v0.0.2
------

Dependent on `fun_with_testing` and `fun_with_files`, even `fun_with_version_strings`.  It's all very silly, really.


0.0.1
-----




0.0.0
-----

No changes!
